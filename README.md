# Remote Access Tool #

# Description #

Remote Access Tool.  I created it so that I could understand how one could go about detecting RATs that may have different behavior.  Rather than finding one every time I wanted a particular behavior, I decided to write one so I could modify it.  This will allow me to add whatever behavior I may wish to monitor.

# Details #

This was created using Code::Blocks in Windows (with the mingw compiler).  It has been successfully compiled and tested in 32- and 64-bit versions of Windows 7, 8, and 10.  You should be able to download Code::Blocks and open either the client or the server.  They both compile as statically-linked binaries, so there are no dependencies necessary from the OS. This is in very early stages of development.  Stay tuned.

This was written for research purposes only.  Please do not do anything stupid with it.  If you get caught, that's on you.  I cannot be held responsible for others' bad decisions.
Though I wrote most of this code, I'm sure I grabbed pieces from other places.
